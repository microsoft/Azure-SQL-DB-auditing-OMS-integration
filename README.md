# Azure SQL DB Auditing log integration into OMS

This is a **sync application** that runs in Azure and utilizes OMS public APIs to push SQL audit logs into OMS.

It allows using OMS Log Analytics to explore and analyze your database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate potential business concerns or suspected security violations.  

[Azure SQL Database Auditing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=403539) tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure Storage account. Azure SQL Database Auditing can help you maintain regulatory compliance, understand database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations.

[Operations Management Suite (OMS) Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/log-analytics-log-searches/) helps you correlate, search, and act on log and performance data generated by operating systems, applications and databases. It gives you real-time operational insights using integrated search and custom dashboards to readily analyze millions of records across all of your workloads and servers. For additional useful information about OMS Log Analytics search language and commands, see [Log Analytics search reference](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/log-analytics-log-searches/).

# Troubleshooting

> Once the sync application is deployed in Azure, it can take up to 5-10 minutes for initial data to start appearing in your OMS workspace.

If you've completed the setup process but don't see audit data in your OMS workspace, you'll be able to review the logs for the import operation job in the Azure portal to try and identify the problem:

1. Go to the App Service that you created during the deployment of the sync application.

2. Click on "WebJobs" on the left menu and then on "Logs" in the top menu.
