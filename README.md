#Azure SQL DB Auditing log integration into OMS


# You can now directly set OMS as your Azure SQL DB auditing logs target, eliminating the need for this sync application.
OMS and Event Hubs have been added as built-in auditing targets alongside Blob storage. This new capability can reduce your auditing costs and is much more reliable than using the sync application.
For further information and instructions please visit https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing#subheading-2

This is a **sync application** that runs in Azure and utilizes OMS public APIs to push SQL audit logs into OMS.

It allows using OMS Log Analytics to explore and analyze your database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate potential business concerns or suspected security violations.  

[Azure SQL Database Auditing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=403539) tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure Storage account. Azure SQL Database Auditing can help you maintain regulatory compliance, understand database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations.

[Operations Management Suite (OMS) Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/log-analytics-log-searches/) helps you correlate, search, and act on log and performance data generated by operating systems, applications and databases. It gives you real-time operational insights using integrated search and custom dashboards to readily analyze millions of records across all of your workloads and servers. For additional useful information about OMS Log Analytics search language and commands, see [Log Analytics search reference](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/log-analytics-log-searches/).

###<a id="subheading-2-3">Deploy sync application to Azure</a>

1. Click on the **Deploy to Azure** button below to initiate deployment process. 

	> During deployment, use the **Storage Connection String**, **Workspace ID**, and **Primary Key** that you saved in the previous steps.

2. When deployment is completed, you can close the web application browser window. 
	
	> You will not be required to access this application, it will be running in the background, periodically pushing the audit logs to OMS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the sync application is deployed in Azure, it can take up to 5-10 minutes for initial data to start appearing in your OMS workspace.

###<a id="subheading-2-4">Import Azure SQL DB audit sync dashboard to OMS</a>

1. Download [SQLDatabaseAudit.omsview][101] to your PC.

2. From the OMS dashboard, click on the **View Designer** tile.

	![Navigation Pane][4]

3. At the top of the View Designer page, click on **Import**. An **Upload from computer** will appear at the bottom of the page - choose the **SQLDatabaseAudit.omsview** file that you downloaded to your PC in step 1. Then click **Save** at the top.

# Troubleshooting

> Once the sync application is deployed in Azure, it can take up to 5-10 minutes for initial data to start appearing in your OMS workspace.

If you've completed the setup process but don't see audit data in your OMS workspace, you'll be able to review the logs for the import operation job in the Azure portal to try and identify the problem:

1. Go to the App Service that you created during the deployment of the sync application.

2. Click on "WebJobs" on the left menu and then on "Logs" in the top menu.
